 Fatty acid  	 A carboxyl group with a long hydrocarbon tail.  
 Unsaturated fatty acids  	 Contains double bonds in its hydrocarbon tail. Liquid at room temp.(ie. Oleic acid)  
 Saturated fatty acids  	 Has no double  bonds in its hydrocarbon tail. Solid at room temp. (ie. Stearic acid)  
 Triacylglycerols  	 Storage version of fatty acids. 3 fatty acids linked to a glycerol via ester bonds. (ie. Fat droplets)  
 Steroids  	 Cholesterol - in lipid membranes. Testosterone - male hormone.  
 Glycolipids  	 Similar to phospholipids but contains one or more sugar residues on its head, rather than a phosphate gruop.  
 Phospholipids  	 Consists of two kinked, hydrophobic, fatty acid tails; a glycerol group; and on the head a phosphate group which is further linked to one of a variety of polar (hydrophilic) groups.  
 Primary structure bonds  	 Absolute sequence of amino acids. -Has peptide bonds.  
 Secondary structure bonds  	 Results from interactions between closely bonded amino acids along the backbone. -Has H bonds.  
 Tertiary structure  	 Results from interactions between R groups along a single chain. -Has H bonds, diisulfide bonds, van der Waals forces, ionic bonds, and hydrophobic interactions.  
 Quaternary structure  	 R group interactions between multiple protein chains (subunits). -Has H bonds, diisulfide bonds, van der Waals forces, ionic bonds, and hydrophobic interactions.  
 Alpha helices  	 -spiral shaped -H bonding is maximal and parallel. -allows extensibility.  
 Beta pleated sheet  	 -highly flattened, extended sheetlike shape. -H bonding is maximal and perpendicular. -strong and flexible.
